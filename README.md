Project Timeline: (Over Christmas break - Start of Spring semester)

Project Topic- Simple Accounting System and Banking

Language: Java 
(This will be similar to Gibson's 1302 course with Platinum, gold, etc... accounts)

Project will consist of 3 phases:

1) Creation of classes w/ their respective helper methods:
     -Bank's perspective 
     -Customer's perspective 
     -(Debatable) Money class 

2) Gui implementation for the full experience of start to finish of a customer creatinga an account and how the bank manages the registry of the account along with the customer's money

3) (may blend into 2 ) Scenebuilder- which also help cut phase 2 programming time down a bit.  It is a software to help with designing guis making life easier and simple.
